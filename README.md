## Description
This project is to build my personal portfolio using React. This would include my personal bio, skills, experiences and contact information. 

## Default ReadMe
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
